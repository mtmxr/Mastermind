You are the codemaker. As the codemaker, choose a pattern of four colors. 
Six colors to choose from are: BLUE, GREEN, ORANGE, PURPLE, RED and YELLOW. 
Duplicates are allowed, so you may choose a pattern of four of the same color.

Mastermind codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten  turns. 

Start Mastermind by clicking START GAME button at the bottom of the board. 

Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. 

In the answer pad, indicate which colored pegs are correct:
* WHITE (left mouse click) correct in both color and position
* BLACK (right mouse click) color correct but in wrong position
* leave EMPTY if neither the color nor the position is correct

Click SUBMIT ANSWER

Mastermind will try to guess your code within 10 turns.
